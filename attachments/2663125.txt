Amendment 1 (NEW) 
Proposal for a regulation (AI Regulation) 
Article 6 para 1 
Text proposed by the Commission 
Amendment 
Irrespective of whether an AI system is 
placed on the market or put into 
service independently from the 
products referred to in points (a) and 
(b), that AI system shall be considered 
high-risk where both of the following 
conditions are fulfilled: 
(a) the AI system is intended to be 
used as a safety component of a 
product, or is itself a product, covered 
by the Union harmonisation legislation 
listed in Annex II; 
(b) the product whose safety 
component is the AI system, or the AI 
system itself as a product, is required 
to undergo a third-party conformity 
assessment with a view to the placing 
on the market or putting into service of 
that product pursuant to the Union 
harmonisation legislation listed in 
Annex II. 
Irrespective of whether an AI system is 
placed on the market or put into 
service independently from the 
products referred to in points (a) and 
(b), that AI system shall be considered 
high-risk where both of the following 
conditions are fulfilled: 
(a) the AI system is intended to be 
used as a the only/main/basic 
safety component of a product, or is 
itself a product, covered by the Union 
harmonisation legislation listed in 
Annex II; 
(b) the product whose the 
only/main/basic safety component is 
the AI system, or the AI system itself 
as a product, is required to undergo a 
third-party conformity assessment with 
a view to the placing on the market or 
putting into service of that product 
pursuant to the Union harmonisation 
legislation listed in Annex II. 
Or. en 
Justification 
Only products which basic safety features are secured ONLY by the AI system should be 
considered high-risk. If basic safety functions required by e.g. LVD and RED are fully 
secured outside AI system and AI systems provides ONLY additional, non-essential safety 
function, then the product should not be considered high-risk. 

Amendment 2 (NEW) 
Proposal for a regulation (AI Regulation) 
Article 41 para 1 
Text proposed by the Commission 
Amendment 
Where harmonised standards referred 
to in Article 40 do not exist or where 
the Commission considers that the 
relevant harmonised standards are 
insufficient or that there is a need to 
address specific safety or fundamental 
right concerns, the Commission may, 
by means of implementing acts, adopt 
common specifications in respect of the 
requirements set out in Chapter 2 of 
this Title. Those implementing acts 
shall be adopted in accordance with 
the examination procedure referred to 
in Article 74(2). 
Where harmonised standards referred 
to in Article 40 do not exist and none 
of the ESOs are willing to develop 
them or the Commission has 
justified THE reasons for not 
publishing in the Official Journal of 
the European Union harmonised 
standards, when developed by the 
Standardisation Organisations, visà-vis the Committee of Standards 
referred to in Article 22 of 
Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012 
and that Committee has endorsed 
the justification applying Article 5 
of Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 or 
where the Commission presents 
objective evidence considers that 
the relevant harmonised standards are 
insufficient or that there is a need to 
address specific safety or fundamental 
right concerns and none of the ESOs 
are willing to take up the task, the 
Commission may, by means of 
implementing acts, adopt common 
specifications in respect of the 
requirements set out in Chapter 2 of 
this Title. Those implementing acts 
shall be adopted in accordance with 
the examination procedure referred to 
in Article 74(2). 
Or. en 
Justification 
All actors involved in the standardisation should have very clear overview in what situations 
the “implementing acts path” can be initiated. It cannot be arbitrary or left to subjective 
assessment of one party in the system.
